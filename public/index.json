	"content": "Deploy GameTracker on AWS 🎯 Workshop Objective In this workshop, we will manually deploy the GameTracker platform—a full-stack web application—to AWS from scratch. You will build a serverless-ready architecture using industry-standard services.\nThe goal is to create a production-like environment in the Sydney (ap-southeast-2) region, covering everything from networking to application deployment.\n🏗️ Architecture Overview The solution adopts a modern cloud-native architecture:\nFrontend: React Single Page Application (SPA) hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed via Amazon CloudFront. Backend: Spring Boot application containerized with Docker, stored in Amazon ECR, and running serverless on AWS Lambda exposed via API Gateway. Database: SQL Server Express running on Amazon RDS for structured game data. Network: A custom VPC with public/private subnets and security groups to ensure isolation and security. 📋 Services Used We will configure the following AWS services:\nCategory Services Networking VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway (optional), Route53 Compute AWS Lambda, API Gateway (HTTP API) Storage Amazon S3 (Frontend \u0026amp; Assets) Database Amazon RDS (SQL Server) Container Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) CDN \u0026amp; Security Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, IAM, Security Groups 🚀 Deployment Steps This workshop is divided into logical phases:\nNetwork Setup: Creating VPC, Subnets, and Routing. Database Provisioning: Setting up RDS SQL Server. Backend Deployment: Creating an ECR Repository. Building and pushing the Docker image. Creating the Lambda function and connecting it to the database. Exposing the backend via API Gateway. Frontend Deployment: Creating S3 buckets. Setting up CloudFront distribution. Deploying the React application. Clean up: Instructions on how to decommission resources to avoid costs. �️ Prerequisites An active AWS Account. AWS CLI installed and configured. Docker installed locally. Basic knowledge of terminal commands. Note: Some resources like RDS and NAT Gateway incur hourly costs. Please follow the Cleanup section immediately after finishing the workshop to avoid unexpected charges.\n"

	"content": "\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only. Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nGetting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Using Microservices Data lakes can help hospitals and healthcare facilities turn data into business insights, maintain business continuity, and protect patient privacy. A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”\nThis solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post.

	"content": "Part I: Introduction to Kiro.dev (AWS Agentic IDE) Kiro.dev (pronounced “keer-oh”) is an agentic AI-powered IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by a small team at Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is currently in public preview.\n1. Goal \u0026amp; Key Features Goal: Bridge the gap between \u0026ldquo;vibe coding\u0026rdquo; (rapid prototyping) and structured, tested, documented, and maintainable real-world software development. Key Features: TaSpec-Driven Development: Converts requirements into user stories, acceptance criteria, design documents, and task lists. Agent Hooks / Automation: Automatically triggers tasks like documentation generation, testing, and optimization upon events (file save, commit). Steering: Uses Markdown files to clearly define project structure, standards, and architecture. Multi-file Capability: Understands functional goals and executes necessary changes across multiple files. 2. Pros and Cons Type Details Pros Increased transparency \u0026amp; control (spec review before code), Reduced boilerplate burden, Security \u0026amp; privacy (local code generation), Flexibility (external tool integration via Model Context Protocol). Cons Still in preview (incomplete features), May struggle with \u0026ldquo;context understanding\u0026rdquo; in complex projects (requires user supervision), Costs associated with agent interaction. 3. Usage Recommendations Kiro is suitable if you want to maintain a professional, structured workflow while leveraging AI for rapid prototyping, or if you want AI to be a \u0026ldquo;coding partner\u0026rdquo; rather than just a code suggestion tool.\nPart II: Important Notes on Effective AI Usage Here are core experiences and principles when working with AI in software development projects:\n1. Control Principles User must be in control: AI is just an assistant; do not rely on it to control the project. Plan First \u0026amp; Review Frequently: You MUST CREATE A PLAN FIRST (e.g., ask AI to create a plan file) to have a working framework and must frequently review (don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to do everything). Code Manager Role: Your value lies in code validation. You must be the one managing the code generated by AI. 2. Prompt Engineering \u0026amp; Requirement Definition Specific Role: Assign a specific role to the AI (e.g., suggest using Amazon Q/CodeWhisperer). Prompt Templates: Ask AI to create a plan, then filter and refine it. Request it to export files for storage and direct editing later. Clear Definition: Create a new section when writing user stories. Define technology clearly for AI to follow. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t implement this,\u0026rdquo; say \u0026ldquo;implement this part\u0026rdquo; to increase success probability. Detailed Collaboration: Collaborate with AI to create clear requirements and detailed information before asking AI to design and proceed. 3. Project Management Break Down Scope: Divide large scope into scope units; each unit is a small project for easier implementation. Collaborate \u0026amp; Verify: Ask AI to write user stories, then base project time estimation on them. Must have a team working together and verify all output code. Basic Process: Requirement $\\implies$ Unit $\\implies$ Data Model $\\implies$ \u0026hellip; $\\implies$ Verify. Part III: Software Development Process Diagram (Agile/Scrum) The software development process typically follows Agile/Scrum, involving roles such as Product Owner, Developer, and Tester.\n1. Development Cycle Starts from the Backlog (list of requirements), requirements are prioritized and assigned to each Sprint. In each Sprint, the development team performs key activities: Design, Code, and Test. 2. Deliverables \u0026amp; Deployment Environments Artifacts: Design documents, content maps, service interfaces, source code, configurations. Deployment Environments: Products are sequentially deployed through environments: Development (Dev) Testing (QA) User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Production (Prod) – Official running environment. This process ensures the relationship between roles, activities, results, and deployment environments, helping control product quality before release to users.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Customer Background GameTracker is a platform designed for game players and admins to manage, track, and share information about characters, weapons, banners, items, and events.\nBusiness and Technical Objectives\nUnified Management: Create a centralized system for managing game data effectively. Accessibility: Provide easy access to information for English-language games which can be a barrier for some users. Efficiency: Reduce manual maintenance time and improve data reliability for admins. Scalability: Build a system scalable to multiple games and community features using serverless architecture. Use Cases\nPlayers: Track gacha history, simulate pulls, view banner/event timelines. Admins: Manage game data (CRUD) with clear access permissions. Partner Professional Services We will deliver a full-stack web application hosted on AWS, utilizing serverless technologies (Lambda, S3, RDS) to ensure low operational costs and high availability.\n1.2 PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA System Stability: Stable, auto-scaling system with low maintenance costs. Security: Secure API with centralized data management and role-based access control. User Engagement: Functional gacha tools and timelines that help players track game events conveniently. Scalability: Architecture ready for easy expansion to support more games and features. 1.3 ASSUMPTIONS Prerequisites: AWS account access with necessary permissions for deployment. Dependencies: Third-party authentication (Google OAuth2). Constraints: Budget constraints requiring a low-cost serverless approach. Risks: Potential cold start latency with Lambda (mitigated by warmers), RDS costs (mitigated by instance selection). 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM 2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM Proposed High-Level Architecture: The solution adopts a modern cloud-native architecture:\nFrontend: React SPA served via S3 + CloudFront, protected by AWS WAF. Backend: Spring Boot serverless deployed on AWS Lambda, using JWT and Google OAuth2 for auth. Database: SQL Server on AWS RDS. Storage: AWS S3 for storing static assets (avatars, backgrounds, weapons). Security: AWS WAF, IAM, and Spring Security. AWS Services Used:\nAWS S3, AWS Lambda, AWS RDS, AWS CloudFront, AWS WAF, AWS SES, AWS IAM. 2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN We will develop scripts using AWS CDK/CloudFormation or manual setup procedures documented for repeatability.\nFrontend: React, TypeScript, Vite. Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Security. DevOps: Docker, CI/CD pipelines. All critical paths including user login, data synchronization, and gacha simulation will include extensive test coverage.\n2.3 PROJECT PLAN The project will follow an Agile methodology over a 1-month timeline.\nWeek 1: Planning, Requirements Analysis, Architecture Design. Week 2: Backend Development (API, Auth, Database). Week 3: Frontend Development (UI/UX, Admin Dashboard, Tools). Week 4: Deployment, Testing, Documentation, and Handover. 2.4 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Best Practices Implemented:\nIdentity: Google OAuth2 integration and JWT for secure stateless authentication. Infrastructure: AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits. Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) for Admins vs Users. Data Protection: HTTPS encryption in transit; RDS encryption at rest. Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics. 3. ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERABLES 3.1 ACTIVITIES AND DELIVERABLES Project Phase Timeline Activities Deliverables/Milestones Assessment \u0026amp; Setup Week 1 Requirement analysis, architecture design, AWS setup (S3, RDS, Lambda) Architecture Diagram, AWS Environment Ready Backend Implementation Week 2 Build Lambda functions, API endpoints, Auth integration, DB schema Working API, Database connectivity Frontend Implementation Week 3 React SPA development, Dashboard creation, Gacha tools logic Functional Web UI, Admin Dashboard Testing \u0026amp; Go-live Week 4 Integration testing, Security optimization, Deployment to CloudFront Deployed Application, User Guide, Documentation 3.2 OUT OF SCOPE Mobile Application development (iOS/Android native apps). Real-time multiplayer game server features (only web-based data management). Integration with game servers directly (data is manually managed/imported). 3.3 PATH TO PRODUCTION The current proposal outlines the path to a production-ready MVP.\nPOC to Prod: The system is designed to be production-grade from the start using AWS managed services. Gaps: Further load testing and fine-tuning of WAF rules may be needed based on actual traffic patterns. Operations: Error handling and monitoring are implemented via CloudWatch. 4. EXPECTED AWS COST BREAKDOWN BY SERVICES Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$121-123/month\nAWS Lambda: ~$5-7 (Memory: 3008 MB, ~12k invocations). S3 Standard: ~$0.23 (10 GB storage). CloudFront: ~$8.50 (100 GB egress). RDS (SQL Server): ~$60+ (db.t3.medium or similar). AWS WAF: ~$10 (Web ACL + requests). NAT Gateway: ~$32 (if required for Lambda in VPC). Others (SES, Route53, CloudWatch): ~$6. Note: Costs are estimates and depend on actual usage and region.\n5.

	"content": "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Overview of Amazon RDS ℹ️ Information: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that allows you to deploy and manage relational databases on AWS. Amazon RDS is designed for online transaction processing (OLTP) and is best suited for structured, relational data storage requirements.\nAmazon RDS provides key benefits:\nEasy replacement for traditional database instances Automated backups and patching during customer-defined maintenance windows One-click scaling, replication, and availability Supported Database Engines Amazon RDS supports the following database engines:\nAmazon Aurora MySQL MariaDB Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL ⚠️ Warning: RDS is a managed service and you don\u0026rsquo;t have root access to the underlying EC2 server. The exception is Amazon RDS Custom, which allows access to the underlying operating system but is only available for a limited set of DB Engines.\nStorage Options General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2): Cost-effective storage providing 3 IOPS/GB baseline performance Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2): High-performance storage with customizable IOPS for I/O-intensive workloads Magnetic Storage: Legacy option with limited performance (not recommended for new deployments) 💡 Pro Tip: Choose General Purpose SSD for most workloads, and Provisioned IOPS only when you need consistent I/O performance for database-intensive applications.\nHigh Availability and Disaster Recovery Multi-AZ Deployments: Synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone for automatic failover Read Replicas: Asynchronous replication for read scaling and potential disaster recovery Global Databases: Cross-region replication with fast local reads and disaster recovery capabilities 🔒 Security Note: Multi-AZ deployments enhance both availability and data durability, with automatic failover typically completing within 60-120 seconds.\nSecurity Features Encryption at rest: Using AWS KMS keys (applies to DB instances, backups, snapshots, and replicas) Network isolation: Using Amazon VPC for network-level isolation Resource-level permissions: Using IAM policies SSL/TLS encryption: For data in transit Database authentication: Using database engine native authentication or IAM authentication Scalability and Limits Storage can be scaled up (not down) without downtime Compute resources can be modified with a brief downtime during the change Maximum storage: 64 TiB for most engines (16 TiB for SQL Server) Maximum database connections: Varies by engine and instance size 💡 Pro Tip: Plan your initial storage carefully as you can only scale up. Consider using Aurora for more flexible scaling options.\nBackup and Recovery Automated backups: Point-in-time recovery for up to 35 days Manual snapshots: User-initiated backups that persist until explicitly deleted Snapshot export to S3: For long-term retention or analysis When to Use Amazon RDS Amazon RDS is ideal for:\nTraditional relational database workloads Applications requiring SQL query capabilities Structured data with well-defined schemas OLTP workloads with predictable scaling needs ℹ️ Information: For unstructured data, high-scale requirements, or specialized workloads, consider alternative AWS database services like DynamoDB, DocumentDB, or purpose-built databases.\n"

View Snapshots:\nIn the left navigation pane, click Snapshots. You will see a list of all manual and automated snapshots. Restoring from a DB Snapshot ℹ️ Information: Restoring a snapshot creates a new DB instance. It does not overwrite the existing one.\nSelect Snapshot:\nChoose the DB snapshot you want to restore. Click Actions \u0026gt; Restore snapshot. Configure New Instance:\nDB instance identifier: Enter a unique name for the new instance (e.g., workshop-db-restore). Instance specifications: Select the instance class (e.g., db.t3.micro). Connectivity: Select the same VPC and Subnet Group as your original instance. Security: Choose the correct Security Group. 💡 Pro Tip: When restoring for testing, you can choose a smaller instance class to save costs.\nInitiate Restore:\nClick Restore DB instance. ⚠️ Warning: The restore process creates a completely new database instance with a new endpoint. You must update your application\u0026rsquo;s connection string to point to this new endpoint.\nVerify:\nWait for the status to change to Available. Test connectivity to the new instance. "
