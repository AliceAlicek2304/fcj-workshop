	"content": "Creating a VPC with Subnets and Associated Resources ℹ️ Information: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is your private network in the cloud. It allows you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you define, giving you complete control over your network environment.\nWe will use the VPC and more wizard to create our VPC, subnets, route tables, and internet gateway in a single workflow.\nStep-by-Step Guide Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.\nOn the VPC dashboard, choose Create VPC.\nUnder Resources to create, select VPC and more. This option automatically provisions related resources like subnets and route tables.\nName tag auto-generation: Enter a name for your project (e.g., workshop-vpc). This will be used as a prefix for all created resources.\nIPv4 CIDR block: Keep the default (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) or enter your preferred range.\nAvailability Zones (AZs): Select 2. This is critical for High Availability and Multi-AZ deployments.\nNumber of public subnets: Select 2. These will host resources that need direct internet access (like a bastion host or load balancer).\nNumber of private subnets: Select 2. These will host your RDS database instances, keeping them secure from the public internet.\n🔒 Security Note: Always place your database instances in private subnets.\nNAT gateways: Select 1 per AZ or 1 in 1 AZ depending on your cost preference. For this workshop, None or 1 in 1 AZ is sufficient if you need outbound internet access for private instances (e.g., for updates).\n💡 Pro Tip: In a production environment, deploying a NAT Gateway in each AZ ensures high availability but incurs higher costs.\nVPC endpoints: Leave as None for this workshop.\nDNS options: Ensure Enable DNS hostnames and Enable DNS resolution are checked. These are required for RDS to function correctly with public access (if needed) and for easier internal resolution.\nReview the Preview pane to visualize your network architecture.\nClick Create VPC.\nConfiguring Public IP Assignment (Optional) ℹ️ Information: By default, instances in non-default subnets do not get public IP addresses. If you want instances in your Public Subnets to automatically get a public IP, follow these steps:\nGo to Subnets in the left navigation pane.\nSelect one of your Public Subnets.\nClick Actions \u0026gt; Edit subnet settings.\nCheck Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address.\nClick Save.\nRepeat for your other Public Subnet.\n⚠️ Warning: Never enable auto-assign public IP for your Private Subnets where your database resides.\n"

	"content": "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) ℹ️ Information: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.\nOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP) Amazon RDS is optimized for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) workloads.\nPrimary Use Case It is primarily designed for transactional applications requiring a structured, relational data store, rather than analytical workloads.\nDrop-in Replacement RDS serves as a seamless drop-in replacement for your existing on-premises database instances, allowing you to use the same code, applications, and tools you already use.\nKey Features Automated Maintenance: Backups and software patching are handled automatically during maintenance windows you define. Scalability \u0026amp; Availability: Offers push-button scaling, replication, and high availability options. Supported Database Engines Amazon RDS supports six popular database engines:\nAmazon Aurora MySQL MariaDB Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL Managed Service Benefits ℹ️ Information: As a managed service, RDS restricts access to the underlying EC2 instance (no root access) to ensure stability and security.\n💡 Pro Tip: If you need access to the underlying operating system, Amazon RDS Custom is available for Oracle and SQL Server engines.\nThe managed service model includes:\nSecurity: Hardening and patching of DB instances. Reliability: Automated backups and multi-AZ synchronous replication for high availability. Maintenance: Automatic software updates for the DB engine. Scalability: Easy vertical (compute) and horizontal (read replicas) scaling. Resilience: Automatic failover in Multi-AZ configurations. DB Instance A DB instance is an isolated database environment in the cloud. You define the compute and storage resources it uses.\nAccess via Endpoints You connect to your database using endpoints. These can be found in the DB instance details within the AWS Management Console, or retrieved via the DescribeDBInstances API or CLI command.\nInstance Limits ⚠️ Warning: By default, you are limited to 40 Amazon RDS DB instances per account. Of these, up to 10 can be Oracle or SQL Server under the \u0026ldquo;License Included\u0026rdquo; model.\nMaintenance Windows Maintenance windows allow you to control when DB modifications (like scaling or patching) occur. You can specify a weekly time slot, or let AWS assign a 30-minute window randomly.\nWindows Integrated Authentication For SQL Server, Windows Integrated Authentication is supported only when using AWS Directory Service domains. You must establish a trust relationship with your on-premises AD if needed.\nEvents and Notifications Amazon RDS uses Amazon SNS to deliver notifications about important database events.\nAPI: Use DescribeEvents to see events from the past 14 days. CLI: View events from the past 14 days. Console: View events from the past 1 day only. Use Cases, Alternatives, and Anti-Patterns Use the table below to decide if RDS is the right choice for your needs:\nData Store Best Used When\u0026hellip; Database on EC2 - You need full control over the OS and DB configuration.\n- Your preferred DB engine isn\u0026rsquo;t supported by RDS. Amazon RDS - You need a traditional relational database for OLTP.\n- Data is structured and well-formed.\n- Migrating existing apps that require an RDBMS. Amazon DynamoDB - Data is unstructured (name/value pairs) or unpredictable.\n- You need extreme scale and low-latency performance.\n- High I/O throughput is required. Amazon RedShift - You have massive datasets for analytics (OLAP). Amazon Neptune - Data value is derived from relationships between objects (Graph DB). Amazon ElastiCache - You need fast, in-memory caching for frequently accessed data. Amazon S3 - Storing large binary objects (BLOBs) or static website content. Alternative to Amazon RDS:\nIf RDS doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet your specific requirements, running a database on Amazon EC2 is a viable alternative.\nConsider EC2 if:\nYou need maximum flexibility and control. You are willing to manage backups, redundancy, patching, and scaling yourself. You use a database engine not supported by RDS (e.g., IBM DB2, SAP HANA). Anti-Patterns:\nAvoid using RDS for the following scenarios:\nRequirement Better Alternative Storing large binary objects (BLOBs) Amazon S3 Infinite Automated Scalability Amazon DynamoDB Unstructured / Name-Value Data Amazon DynamoDB Complex Graph Relationships Amazon Neptune Complete OS/DB Control Amazon EC2 Encryption 🔒 Security Note: You can encrypt your RDS instances and snapshots at rest using AWS KMS. This is a best practice for sensitive data.\nEncryption at rest covers:\nDB instance storage Automated backups Read Replicas Snapshots ⚠️ Warning: You cannot encrypt an existing unencrypted DB instance directly. You must create a snapshot, copy it as an encrypted snapshot, and then restore a new DB instance from that encrypted snapshot.\nSSL Encryption: RDS supports SSL for encrypting data in transit between your application and the database.\nDB Subnet Groups ℹ️ Information: A DB subnet group defines which subnets and IP ranges the RDS instance can use within your VPC.\n💡 Pro Tip: Always include subnets from at least two Availability Zones in your subnet group to enable Multi-AZ deployments.\nBilling and Provisioning You are charged for:\nCompute: DB instance hours (partial hours billed as full). Storage: GB per month. I/O: Requests/month (Magnetic) or Provisioned IOPS/month (SSD). Data Transfer: Outbound data transfer. Backup Storage: Storage for manual snapshots and automated backups (in excess of your DB storage size). Note: Multi-AZ deployments incur costs for the standby instance, storage, and I/O, but data transfer between the primary and standby is free.\nReserved Instances: You can purchase Reserved Instances (RIs) for significant discounts. RIs are tied to specific attributes:\nDB Engine Instance Class Deployment Type (Single-AZ or Multi-AZ) License Model Region Scalability ℹ️ Information: RDS supports vertical scaling (instance type) and storage scaling.\nStorage: Can be increased while the instance is running (zero downtime, potential performance impact). You cannot decrease storage size. Compute: Changing instance type requires a brief reboot (downtime). ⚠️ Warning: Maximum storage size is 64 TiB for most engines, but 16 TiB for SQL Server.\nPerformance RDS uses EBS volumes for storage. Choose the right type for your workload:\nGeneral Purpose (SSD - gp2/gp3): Balanced performance for most workloads. Cost-effective. Provisioned IOPS (SSD - io1/io2): For I/O intensive, latency-sensitive workloads. You specify the exact IOPS needed. Magnetic: Legacy storage, not recommended for new workloads. Multi-AZ and Read Replicas Feature Multi-AZ Deployments Read Replicas Purpose High Availability (HA) \u0026amp; Disaster Recovery (DR) Read Scalability \u0026amp; Performance Replication Synchronous (Zero data loss) Asynchronous (Eventual consistency) Active Nodes Only Primary is active All replicas are active for reads Backups Taken from Standby (no I/O impact on Primary) Not configured by default Failover Automatic Manual promotion required Multi-AZ Details ℹ️ Information: Multi-AZ creates a standby replica in a different Availability Zone.\nAutomatic Failover: Triggered by infrastructure failure, network loss, or instance failure. Seamless: DNS endpoint automatically updates to point to the standby. Recommendation: Use Provisioned IOPS for Multi-AZ to ensure consistent replication performance. 💡 Pro Tip: Always use the DNS endpoint in your application connection strings, never the IP address, to ensure failover works correctly.\n⚠️ Warning: The standby instance in a Multi-AZ setup cannot be used for read traffic.\nRead Replicas Details ℹ️ Information: Offload read traffic from your primary instance to Read Replicas.\nScalability: Up to 5 read replicas per master. Flexibility: Can be in the same AZ, different AZ, or even a different Region (Cross-Region). Promotion: A Read Replica can be manually promoted to a standalone master database. 💡 Pro Tip: You can promote a Read Replica to become the new master. This process takes a few minutes.\nDB Snapshots ℹ️ Information: User-initiated backups of your instance.\nStored on S3 indefinitely until you delete them. Restoration: Creates a brand new DB instance with a new endpoint. Sharing: Snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts. 💡 Pro Tip: Always take a final snapshot before deleting a production database.\nMonitoring Use these tools to keep your database healthy:\nAmazon CloudWatch: Metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and Alarms. Enhanced Monitoring: Real-time OS metrics. Performance Insights: Visualizes database load and helps identify bottlenecks. RDS Events: Notifications about configuration changes or failovers. 💡 Pro Tip: Combine these tools for a comprehensive view of your database\u0026rsquo;s health and performance.\n"

	"content": "\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only. Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nGetting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Using Microservices Data lakes can help hospitals and healthcare facilities turn data into business insights, maintain business continuity, and protect patient privacy. A data lake is a centralized, managed, and secure repository to store all your data, both in its raw and processed forms for analysis. Data lakes allow you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and make better business decisions.\nThis blog post is part of a larger series on getting started with setting up a healthcare data lake. In my final post of the series, “Getting Started with Healthcare Data Lakes: Diving into Amazon Cognito”, I focused on the specifics of using Amazon Cognito and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to authenticate and authorize users in the healthcare data lake solution. In this blog, I detail how the solution evolved at a foundational level, including the design decisions I made and the additional features used. You can access the code samples for the solution in this Git repo for reference.\nArchitecture Guidance The main change since the last presentation of the overall architecture is the decomposition of a single service into a set of smaller services to improve maintainability and flexibility. Integrating a large volume of diverse healthcare data often requires specialized connectors for each format; by keeping them encapsulated separately as microservices, we can add, remove, and modify each connector without affecting the others. The microservices are loosely coupled via publish/subscribe messaging centered in what I call the “pub/sub hub.”\nThis solution represents what I would consider another reasonable sprint iteration from my last post. The scope is still limited to the ingestion and basic parsing of HL7v2 messages formatted in Encoding Rules 7 (ER7) through a REST interface.\nThe solution architecture is now as follows:\nFigure 1. Overall architecture; colored boxes represent distinct services.\nWhile the term microservices has some inherent ambiguity, certain traits are common:\nSmall, autonomous, loosely coupled Reusable, communicating through well-defined interfaces Specialized to do one thing well Often implemented in an event-driven architecture When determining where to draw boundaries between microservices, consider:\nIntrinsic: technology used, performance, reliability, scalability Extrinsic: dependent functionality, rate of change, reusability Human: team ownership, managing cognitive load Technology Choices and Communication Scope Communication scope Technologies / patterns to consider Within a single microservice Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Step Functions Between microservices in a single service AWS CloudFormation cross-stack references, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) Between services Amazon EventBridge, AWS Cloud Map, Amazon API Gateway The Pub/Sub Hub Using a hub-and-spoke architecture (or message broker) works well with a small number of tightly related microservices.\nEach microservice depends only on the hub Inter-microservice connections are limited to the contents of the published message Reduces the number of synchronous calls since pub/sub is a one-way asynchronous push Drawback: coordination and monitoring are needed to avoid microservices processing the wrong message.\nCore Microservice Provides foundational data and communication layer, including:\nAmazon S3 bucket for data Amazon DynamoDB for data catalog AWS Lambda to write messages into the data lake and catalog Amazon SNS topic as the hub Amazon S3 bucket for artifacts such as Lambda code Only allow indirect write access to the data lake through a Lambda function → ensures consistency.\nFront Door Microservice Provides an API Gateway for external REST interaction Authentication \u0026amp; authorization based on OIDC via Amazon Cognito Self-managed deduplication mechanism using DynamoDB instead of SNS FIFO because: SNS deduplication TTL is only 5 minutes SNS FIFO requires SQS FIFO Ability to proactively notify the sender that the message is a duplicate Staging ER7 Microservice Lambda “trigger” subscribed to the pub/sub hub, filtering messages by attribute Step Functions Express Workflow to convert ER7 → JSON Two Lambdas: Fix ER7 formatting (newline, carriage return) Parsing logic Result or error is pushed back into the pub/sub hub New Features in the Solution 1. AWS CloudFormation Cross-Stack References Example outputs in the core microservice:\nOutputs: Bucket: Value: !Ref Bucket Export: Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Bucket ArtifactBucket: Value: !Ref ArtifactBucket Export: Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-ArtifactBucket Topic: Value: !Ref Topic Export: Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Topic Catalog: Value: !Ref Catalog Export: Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-Catalog CatalogArn: Value: !GetAtt Catalog.Arn Export: Name: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-CatalogArn "

	"content": "Part I: Introduction to Kiro.dev (AWS Agentic IDE) Kiro.dev (pronounced “keer-oh”) is an agentic AI-powered IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by a small team at Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is currently in public preview.\n1. Goal \u0026amp; Key Features Goal: Bridge the gap between \u0026ldquo;vibe coding\u0026rdquo; (rapid prototyping) and structured, tested, documented, and maintainable real-world software development. Key Features: TaSpec-Driven Development: Converts requirements into user stories, acceptance criteria, design documents, and task lists. Agent Hooks / Automation: Automatically triggers tasks like documentation generation, testing, and optimization upon events (file save, commit). Steering: Uses Markdown files to clearly define project structure, standards, and architecture. Multi-file Capability: Understands functional goals and executes necessary changes across multiple files. 2. Pros and Cons Type Details Pros Increased transparency \u0026amp; control (spec review before code), Reduced boilerplate burden, Security \u0026amp; privacy (local code generation), Flexibility (external tool integration via Model Context Protocol). Cons Still in preview (incomplete features), May struggle with \u0026ldquo;context understanding\u0026rdquo; in complex projects (requires user supervision), Costs associated with agent interaction. 3. Usage Recommendations Kiro is suitable if you want to maintain a professional, structured workflow while leveraging AI for rapid prototyping, or if you want AI to be a \u0026ldquo;coding partner\u0026rdquo; rather than just a code suggestion tool.\nPart II: Important Notes on Effective AI Usage Here are core experiences and principles when working with AI in software development projects:\n1. Control Principles User must be in control: AI is just an assistant; do not rely on it to control the project. Plan First \u0026amp; Review Frequently: You MUST CREATE A PLAN FIRST (e.g., ask AI to create a plan file) to have a working framework and must frequently review (don\u0026rsquo;t expect it to do everything). Code Manager Role: Your value lies in code validation. You must be the one managing the code generated by AI. 2. Prompt Engineering \u0026amp; Requirement Definition Specific Role: Assign a specific role to the AI (e.g., suggest using Amazon Q/CodeWhisperer). Prompt Templates: Ask AI to create a plan, then filter and refine it. Request it to export files for storage and direct editing later. Clear Definition: Create a new section when writing user stories. Define technology clearly for AI to follow. Instead of saying \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t implement this,\u0026rdquo; say \u0026ldquo;implement this part\u0026rdquo; to increase success probability. Detailed Collaboration: Collaborate with AI to create clear requirements and detailed information before asking AI to design and proceed. 3. Project Management Break Down Scope: Divide large scope into scope units; each unit is a small project for easier implementation. Collaborate \u0026amp; Verify: Ask AI to write user stories, then base project time estimation on them. Must have a team working together and verify all output code. Basic Process: Requirement $\\implies$ Unit $\\implies$ Data Model $\\implies$ \u0026hellip; $\\implies$ Verify. Part III: Software Development Process Diagram (Agile/Scrum) The software development process typically follows Agile/Scrum, involving roles such as Product Owner, Developer, and Tester.\n1. Development Cycle Starts from the Backlog (list of requirements), requirements are prioritized and assigned to each Sprint. In each Sprint, the development team performs key activities: Design, Code, and Test. 2. Deliverables \u0026amp; Deployment Environments Artifacts: Design documents, content maps, service interfaces, source code, configurations. Deployment Environments: Products are sequentially deployed through environments: Development (Dev) Testing (QA) User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Production (Prod) – Official running environment. This process ensures the relationship between roles, activities, results, and deployment environments, helping control product quality before release to users.\n"

	"content": "Overview ℹ️ Information: Before we can launch our Amazon RDS database, we need to lay the groundwork. This involves setting up a secure and robust network infrastructure within your AWS environment.\nIn this section, we will walk through the creation of the following essential components:\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC): The isolated network environment for your resources. Subnets: Network segments distributed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability. Security Groups: Virtual firewalls to control traffic for both your application (EC2) and database (RDS). DB Subnet Group: A collection of subnets that tells RDS where it can provision your database instances. Why is this important? Setting up these components correctly is crucial for:\nSecurity: Isolating your database from public internet access. Availability: Ensuring your database can survive data center failures (Multi-AZ). Connectivity: Allowing your application servers to communicate securely with your database. 💡 Pro Tip: Always design your network with High Availability in mind. By creating subnets in at least two different Availability Zones now, you enable the option for Multi-AZ deployments later.\n🔒 Security Note: We will follow the principle of Least Privilege. Our Security Groups will be configured to allow only necessary traffic on specific ports from authorized sources.\n⚠️ Warning: You cannot create a Multi-AZ RDS deployment if your DB Subnet Group does not span at least two Availability Zones.\n"

	"content": "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Overview of Amazon RDS ℹ️ Information: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that allows you to deploy and manage relational databases on AWS. Amazon RDS is designed for online transaction processing (OLTP) and is best suited for structured, relational data storage requirements.\nAmazon RDS provides key benefits:\nEasy replacement for traditional database instances Automated backups and patching during customer-defined maintenance windows One-click scaling, replication, and availability Supported Database Engines Amazon RDS supports the following database engines:\nAmazon Aurora MySQL MariaDB Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL ⚠️ Warning: RDS is a managed service and you don\u0026rsquo;t have root access to the underlying EC2 server. The exception is Amazon RDS Custom, which allows access to the underlying operating system but is only available for a limited set of DB Engines.\nStorage Options General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2): Cost-effective storage providing 3 IOPS/GB baseline performance Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2): High-performance storage with customizable IOPS for I/O-intensive workloads Magnetic Storage: Legacy option with limited performance (not recommended for new deployments) 💡 Pro Tip: Choose General Purpose SSD for most workloads, and Provisioned IOPS only when you need consistent I/O performance for database-intensive applications.\nHigh Availability and Disaster Recovery Multi-AZ Deployments: Synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone for automatic failover Read Replicas: Asynchronous replication for read scaling and potential disaster recovery Global Databases: Cross-region replication with fast local reads and disaster recovery capabilities 🔒 Security Note: Multi-AZ deployments enhance both availability and data durability, with automatic failover typically completing within 60-120 seconds.\nSecurity Features Encryption at rest: Using AWS KMS keys (applies to DB instances, backups, snapshots, and replicas) Network isolation: Using Amazon VPC for network-level isolation Resource-level permissions: Using IAM policies SSL/TLS encryption: For data in transit Database authentication: Using database engine native authentication or IAM authentication Scalability and Limits Storage can be scaled up (not down) without downtime Compute resources can be modified with a brief downtime during the change Maximum storage: 64 TiB for most engines (16 TiB for SQL Server) Maximum database connections: Varies by engine and instance size 💡 Pro Tip: Plan your initial storage carefully as you can only scale up. Consider using Aurora for more flexible scaling options.\nBackup and Recovery Automated backups: Point-in-time recovery for up to 35 days Manual snapshots: User-initiated backups that persist until explicitly deleted Snapshot export to S3: For long-term retention or analysis When to Use Amazon RDS Amazon RDS is ideal for:\nTraditional relational database workloads Applications requiring SQL query capabilities Structured data with well-defined schemas OLTP workloads with predictable scaling needs ℹ️ Information: For unstructured data, high-scale requirements, or specialized workloads, consider alternative AWS database services like DynamoDB, DocumentDB, or purpose-built databases.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Understanding Amazon RDS Backup and Restore ℹ️ Information: Amazon RDS provides automated backups and allows manual snapshots to ensure your database data is protected and can be recovered when needed. These capabilities are essential for disaster recovery planning and maintaining business continuity.\nMonitoring Backup Status Access Monitoring:\nNavigate to the Databases section in the AWS Management Console. Select your target DB instance. Click on the Monitoring tab to view performance metrics. Managing Backups View Backup Details:\nSelect your DB instance. Navigate to the Maintenance \u0026amp; backups tab. Here you can view both automated and manual backup information and configure backup settings. View Snapshots:\nIn the left navigation pane, click Snapshots. You will see a list of all manual and automated snapshots. Restoring from a DB Snapshot ℹ️ Information: Restoring a snapshot creates a new DB instance. It does not overwrite the existing one.\nSelect Snapshot:\nChoose the DB snapshot you want to restore. Click Actions \u0026gt; Restore snapshot. Configure New Instance:\nDB instance identifier: Enter a unique name for the new instance (e.g., workshop-db-restore). Instance specifications: Select the instance class (e.g., db.t3.micro). Connectivity: Select the same VPC and Subnet Group as your original instance. Security: Choose the correct Security Group. 💡 Pro Tip: When restoring for testing, you can choose a smaller instance class to save costs.\nInitiate Restore:\nClick Restore DB instance. ⚠️ Warning: The restore process creates a completely new database instance with a new endpoint. You must update your application\u0026rsquo;s connection string to point to this new endpoint.\nVerify:\nWait for the status to change to Available. Test connectivity to the new instance. "
