This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.\nFollow these steps to create a VPC with all necessary components for your Amazon RDS deployment:\nOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/. On the VPC dashboard, choose Create VPC.\nFor Resources to create, select VPC and more to create a complete VPC environment.\nConfigure the Name tag auto-generation option based on your preference. This allows AWS to automatically create consistent naming for all VPC resources.\nEnter an IPv4 CIDR block range for your VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16). This defines the IP address range available within your VPC.\n(Optional) To enable IPv6 support, select IPv6 CIDR block and choose an Amazon-provided IPv6 range.\nSelect the appropriate Tenancy option:\nDefault: EC2 instances use the tenancy attribute specified during launch Dedicated: All EC2 instances run on hardware dedicated to your account ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Most workloads should use Default tenancy for cost efficiency. Only select Dedicated when you have specific compliance or licensing requirements.\nFor Number of Availability Zones (AZs), select at least two AZs for high availability.\nConfigure your Number of public subnets and Number of private subnets. For Amazon RDS deployments, you\u0026rsquo;ll typically need private subnets for your database instances and public subnets for resources that need internet access.\nðŸ”’ Security Note: Place your RDS instances in private subnets to enhance security by preventing direct internet access to your databases.\n(Optional) If resources in private subnets need internet access, configure NAT gateways in each AZ where you have resources requiring outbound connectivity.\nðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: For production environments, deploy NAT gateways in each AZ to eliminate cross-AZ dependencies and improve fault tolerance.\n(Optional) For IPv6 outbound connectivity from private subnets, select Yes for Egress-only Internet Gateway.\n(Optional) To enable private access to Amazon S3, select VPC endpoints, S3 Gateway. This creates a gateway endpoint that allows resources in your VPC to access S3 without using the public internet.\nFor DNS options, the default settings enable both DNS resolution and DNS hostnames, which are recommended for most deployments.\n(Optional) Add tags to your VPC by expanding Additional tags and entering key-value pairs.\nReview the Preview pane to see a visual representation of the VPC architecture you\u0026rsquo;ve configured.\nChoose Create VPC to provision all the configured resources.\nConfiguring Public IP Address Assignment for Subnets **ℹ️\\ Information**: The auto-assign public IPv4 address setting determines whether instances launched in a subnet automatically receive public IP addresses. For RDS deployments, your database subnets should typically have this setting disabled.\nTo modify the public IP address assignment behavior for a subnet:\nOpen the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Subnets.\nSelect your subnet and choose Actions, then Edit subnet settings. Configure the Auto-assign public IPv4 address setting:\nChecked: Instances launched in this subnet automatically receive a public IPv4 address Unchecked: Instances launched in this subnet do not receive a public IPv4 address unless specifically requested during launch ðŸ”’ Security Note: For subnets that will host your RDS instances, ensure this setting is unchecked to prevent accidental public IP assignment.\nChoose Save to apply your changes.\n**⚠️\\ Warning**: Default subnets have auto-assign public IPv4 addresses enabled by default. Always verify this setting when using default subnets for database deployments.\n"},{"uri":"https://alicealicek2304.github.io/fcj-workshop/5-workshop/5.1-introduce/","title":"Introduction","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) **ℹ️\\ Information**: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that you can use to launch and manage relational databases on AWS.\nOnline Transaction Processing (OLTP) Amazon RDS is an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) type of database.\nPrimary Use Case The primary use case is a transactional database (rather than an analytical database). It is best suited to structured, relational data store requirements.\nDrop-in Replacement It aims to be a drop-in replacement for existing on-premises instances of the same databases.\nFeatures Automated backups and patching are applied in customer-defined maintenance windows. Push-button scaling, replication, and redundancy. Supported Database Engines Amazon RDS supports the following database engines:\nAmazon Aurora MySQL MariaDB Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL Managed Service **ℹ️\\ Information**: RDS is a managed service, and you do not have access to the underlying EC2 instance (no root access).\n💡 Pro Tip: The exception to the above rule is Amazon RDS Custom, which allows access to the underlying operating system. This is available for Oracle and SQL Server database engines.\nManaged Service Includes The Amazon RDS managed service includes the following:\nSecurity and patching of the DB instances. Automated backup for the DB instances. Software updates for the DB engine. Easy scaling for storage and compute. Multi-AZ option with synchronous replication. Automatic failover for Multi-AZ option. Read replicas option for read-heavy workloads. DB Instance A DB instance is a database environment in the cloud with the compute and storage resources you specify.\nAccess via Endpoints Database instances are accessed via endpoints. Endpoints can be retrieved via the DB instance description in the AWS Management Console, DescribeDBInstances API, or describe-db-instances command.\nInstance Limits **⚠️\\ Warning**: By default, customers are allowed to have up to a total of 40 Amazon RDS DB instances (only 10 of these can be Oracle or MS SQL unless you have your own licenses).\nMaintenance Windows Maintenance windows are configured to allow DB instances modifications to take place, such as scaling and software patching (some operations require the DB instance to be taken offline briefly). You can define the maintenance window, or AWS will schedule a 30-minute window.\nWindows Integrated Authentication Windows integrated authentication for SQL only works with domains created using the AWS directory service – need to establish a trust with an on-premises AD directory.\nEvents and Notifications Amazon RDS uses AWS SNS to send RDS events via SNS notifications. You can use API calls to the Amazon RDS service to list the RDS events in the last 14 days (DescribeEvents API). You can view events from the last 14 days using the CLI. Using the AWS Console, you can only view RDS events for the last 1 day.\nUse Cases, Alternatives, and Anti-Patterns The table below provides guidance on when best to use RDS and several other AWS database/data store services:\nData Store When to Use Database on EC2 - Ultimate control over the database - Preferred DB not available under RDS Amazon RDS - Need traditional relational database for OLTP - Your data is well-formed and structured - Existing apps requiring RDBMS Amazon DynamoDB - Name/value pair data or unpredictable data structure - In-memory performance with persistence - High I/O needs - Scale dynamically Amazon RedShift - Massive amounts of data - Primarily OLAP workloads Amazon Neptune - Relationships between objects a major portion of data value Amazon Elasticache - Fast temporary storage for small amounts of data - Highly volatile data Amazon S3 - BLOBs - Static Websites Alternative to Amazon RDS:\nIf your use case isn\u0026rsquo;t supported on RDS, you can run databases on Amazon EC2.\nConsider the following points when considering a DB on EC2:\nYou can run any database you like with full control and ultimate flexibility. You must manage everything like backups, redundancy, patching, and scaling. Good option if you require a database not yet supported by RDS, such as IBM DB2 or SAP HANA. Good option if it is not feasible to migrate to an AWS-managed database. Anti-Patterns:\nAnti-patterns are certain patterns in architecture or development that are considered bad or sub-optimal practices – i.e. there may be a better service or method to produce the best result.\nThe following table describes requirements that are not a good fit for RDS:\nRequirement More Suitable Service Lots of large binary objects (BLOBs) S3 Automated Scalability DynamoDB Name/Value Data Structure DynamoDB Data is not well structured or unpredictable DynamoDB Other database platforms like IBM DB2 or SAP HANA EC2 Complete control over the database EC2 Encryption 🔒 Security Note: You can encrypt your Amazon RDS instances and snapshots at rest by enabling the encryption option for your Amazon RDS DB instance.\nEncryption at rest is supported for all DB types and uses AWS KMS.\nWhen using encryption at rest, the following elements are also encrypted:\nAll DB snapshots. Backups. DB instance storage. Read Replicas. **⚠️\\ Warning**: You cannot encrypt an existing DB; you need to create a snapshot, copy it, encrypt the copy, then build an encrypted DB from the snapshot.\nData that is encrypted at rest includes the underlying storage for a DB instance, its automated backups, Read Replicas, and snapshots.\nA Read Replica of an Amazon RDS encrypted instance is also encrypted using the same key as the master instance when both are in the same region.\nIf the master and Read Replica are in different regions, you encrypt using the encryption key for that region.\n**⚠️\\ Warning**: You can\u0026rsquo;t have an encrypted Read Replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted Read Replica of an encrypted DB instance.\nEncryption/decryption is handled transparently.\nRDS supports SSL encryption between applications and RDS DB instances.\nRDS generates a certificate for the instance.\nDB Subnet Groups A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you create in a VPC and that you then designate for your DB instances.\n💡 Pro Tip: Each DB subnet group should have subnets in at least two Availability Zones in a given region.\nIt is recommended to configure a subnet group with subnets in each AZ (even for standalone instances).\nDuring the creation of an RDS instance, you can select the DB subnet group and the AZ within the group to place the RDS DB instance in.\nYou cannot pick the IP within the subnet that is allocated.\nBilling and Provisioning AWS Charge for:\nDB instance hours (partial hours are charged as full hours). Storage GB/month. I/O requests/month – for magnetic storage. Provisioned IOPS/month – for RDS provisioned IOPS SSD. Egress data transfer. Backup storage (DB backups and manual snapshots). Backup storage for the automated RDS backup is free of charge up to the provisioned EBS volume size. However, AWS replicates data across multiple AZs, so you are charged for the extra storage space on S3.\nFor multi-AZ, you are charged for:\nMulti-AZ DB hours. Provisioned storage. Double write I/Os. For multi-AZ, you are not charged for DB data transfer during replication from primary to standby.\nOracle and Microsoft SQL licenses are included, or you can bring your own (BYO).\nOn-demand and reserved instance pricing available.\nReserved instances are defined based on the following attributes which must not be changed:\nDB engine. DB instance class. Deployment type (standalone, multi-AZ). License model. Region. Reserved instances:\nCan be moved between AZs in the same region. Are available for multi-AZ deployments. Can be applied to Read Replicas if DB instance class and region are the same. Scaling is achieved through changing the instance class for compute and modifying storage capacity for additional storage allocation.\nScalability You can only scale RDS up (compute and storage).\nYou cannot decrease the allocated storage for an RDS instance.\nYou can scale storage and change the storage type for all DB engines except MS SQL.\nFor MS SQL, the workaround is to create a new instance from a snapshot with the new configuration.\nScaling storage can happen while the RDS instance is running without outage; however, there may be performance degradation.\nScaling compute will cause downtime.\nYou can choose to have changes take effect immediately, however, the default is within the maintenance window.\nScaling requests are applied during the specified maintenance window unless “apply immediately” is used.\nAll RDS DB types support a maximum DB size of 64 TiB except for Microsoft SQL Server (16 TiB).\nPerformance Amazon RDS uses EBS volumes (never uses instance store) for DB and log storage.\nThere are three storage types available: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic.\nGeneral Purpose (SSD):\nUse for Database workloads with moderate I/O requirement. Cost-effective. Also called gp2. 3 IOPS/GB. Burst up to 3000 IOPS. Provisioned IOPS (SSD):\nUse for I/O intensive workloads. Low latency and consistent I/O. User-specified IOPS (see table below). For provisioned IOPS storage, the table below shows the range of Provisioned IOPS and storage size range for each database engine.\nDatabase Engine Range of Provisioned IOPS Range of Storage MariaDB 1,000-80,000 IOPS 100 GiB-64TiB SQL Server 1,000-64,000 IOPS 20 GiB-16TiB MySQL 1,000-80,000 IOPS 100 GiB-64TiB Oracle 1,000-256,000 IOPS 100 GiB-64TiB PostgreSQL 1,000-80,000 IOPS 100 GiB-64TiB Magnetic:\nNot recommended anymore, available for backward compatibility. Doesn’t allow you to scale storage when using the SQL Server database engine. Doesn’t support elastic volumes. Limited to a maximum size of 4 TiB. Limited to a maximum of 1,000 IOPS. Multi-AZ and Read Replicas Multi-AZ and Read Replicas are used for high availability, fault tolerance, and performance scaling.\nThe table below compares multi-AZ deployments to Read Replicas:\nMulti-AZ Deployments Read Replicas Synchronous Replication – highly durable Asynchronous replication – highly scalable Only database engine on primary instance is active All read replicas are accessible and can be used for read scaling Automated backups are taken from standby No backups configured by default Always span two availability zones within a single region Can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region Database engine version upgrades happen on primary Database engine version upgrade is independent from the source instance Automatic failover to standby when a problem is detected Can be manually promoted to a standalone database instance Multi-AZ Multi-AZ RDS creates a replica in another AZ and synchronously replicates to it (DR only).\nThere is an option to choose multi-AZ during the launch wizard.\nAWS recommends the use of provisioned IOPS storage for multi-AZ RDS DB instances.\nEach AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable.\nYou cannot choose which AZ in the region will be chosen to create the standby DB instance.\nYou can view which AZ the standby DB instance is created in.\nA failover may be triggered in the following circumstances:\nLoss of primary AZ or primary DB instance failure. Loss of network connectivity on primary. Compute (EC2) unit failure on primary. Storage (EBS) unit failure on primary. The primary DB instance is changed. Patching of the OS on the primary DB instance. Manual failover (reboot with failover selected on primary). During failover, RDS automatically updates configuration (including DNS endpoint) to use the second node.\nDepending on the instance class, it can take 1 to a few minutes to failover to a standby DB instance.\nIt is recommended to implement DB connection retries in your application.\nRecommended to use the endpoint rather than the IP address to point applications to the RDS DB.\nThe method to initiate a manual RDS DB instance failover is to reboot selecting the option to failover.\nA DB instance reboot is required for changes to take effect when you change the DB parameter group or when you change a static DB parameter.\nThe DB parameter group is a configuration container for the DB engine configuration.\nYou will be alerted by a DB instance event when a failover occurs.\nThe secondary DB in a multi-AZ configuration cannot be used as an independent read node (read or write).\nThere is no charge for data transfer between primary and secondary RDS instances.\nSystem upgrades like OS patching, DB Instance scaling, and system upgrades are applied first on the standby before failing over and modifying the other DB Instance.\nIn multi-AZ configurations, snapshots and automated backups are performed on the standby to avoid I/O suspension on the primary instance.\nRead Replica Support for Multi-AZ: Amazon RDS Read Replicas for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle support Multi-AZ deployments.\nCombining Read Replicas with Multi-AZ enables you to build a resilient disaster recovery strategy and simplify your database engine upgrade process.\nA Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.\nThis allows you to scale reads whilst also having multi-AZ for DR.\nThe process for implementing maintenance activities is as follows:\nPerform operations on standby. Promote standby to primary. Perform operations on new standby (demoted primary). You can manually upgrade a DB instance to a supported DB engine version from the AWS Console.\nBy default, upgrades will take effect during the next maintenance window.\nYou can optionally force an immediate upgrade.\nIn multi-AZ deployments, version upgrades will be conducted on both the primary and standby at the same time, causing an outage of both DB instances.\nEnsure security groups and NACLs will allow your application servers to communicate with both the primary and standby instances.\nRead Replicas Read replicas are used for read-heavy DBs, and replication is asynchronous.\nRead replicas are for workload sharing and offloading.\nRead replicas provide read-only DR.\nRead replicas are created from a snapshot of the master instance.\nMust have automated backups enabled on the primary (retention period \u0026gt; 0).\nOnly supported for transactional database storage engines (InnoDB not InnoDB).\nRead replicas are available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Aurora, and SQL Server.\nFor the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines’ native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance.\nAmazon Aurora employs an SSD-backed virtualized storage layer purpose-built for database workloads.\nYou can take snapshots of PostgreSQL read replicas but cannot enable automated backups.\nYou can enable automatic backups on MySQL and MariaDB read replicas.\nYou can enable writes to the MySQL and MariaDB Read Replicas.\nYou can have 5 read replicas of a production DB.\nYou cannot have more than four instances involved in a replication chain.\nYou can have read replicas of read replicas for MySQL and MariaDB but not for PostgreSQL.\nRead replicas can be configured from the AWS Console or the API.\nYou can specify the AZ the read replica is deployed in.\nThe read replica\u0026rsquo;s storage type and instance class can be different from the source but the compute should be at least the performance of the source.\nYou cannot change the DB engine.\nIn a multi-AZ failover, the read replicas are switched to the new primary.\nRead replicas must be explicitly deleted.\nIf a source DB instance is deleted without deleting the replicas, each replica becomes a standalone single-AZ DB instance.\nYou can promote a read replica to primary.\nPromotion of read replicas takes several minutes.\nPromoted read replicas retain:\nBackup retention window. Backup window. DB parameter group. Existing read replicas continue to function as normal.\nEach read replica has its own DNS endpoint.\nRead replicas can have multi-AZ enabled, and you can create read replicas of multi-AZ source DBs.\nRead replicas can be in another region (uses asynchronous replication).\nThis configuration can be used for centralizing data from across different regions for analytics.\nDB Snapshots DB Snapshots are user-initiated and enable you to back up your DB instance in a known state as frequently as you wish, and then restore to that specific state.\nCannot be used for point-in-time recovery. Snapshots are stored on S3. Snapshots remain on S3 until manually deleted. Backups are taken within a defined window. I/O is briefly suspended while backups initialize and may increase latency (applicable to single-AZ RDS). DB snapshots that are performed manually will be stored even after the RDS instance is deleted. Restored DBs will always be a new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint. Can restore up to the last 5 minutes. Only default DB parameters and security groups are restored – you must manually associate all other DB parameters and SGs. It is recommended to take a final snapshot before deleting an RDS instance. Snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts. High Availability Approaches for Databases If possible, choose DynamoDB over RDS because of inherent fault tolerance.\nIf DynamoDB can’t be used, choose Aurora because of redundancy and automatic recovery features.\nIf Aurora can’t be used, choose Multi-AZ RDS.\nFrequent RDS snapshots can protect against data corruption or failure, and they won’t impact the performance of Multi-AZ deployment.\nRegional replication is also an option but will not be strongly consistent.\nIf the database runs on EC2, you must design the HA yourself.\nMigration AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.\nUse along with the Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to migrate databases to AWS RDS or EC2-based databases.\nThe source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.\nThe AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.\nSchema Conversion Tool can copy database schemas for homogenous migrations (same database) and convert schemas for heterogeneous migrations (different database).\nDMS is used for smaller, simpler conversions and supports MongoDB and DynamoDB.\nSCT is used for larger, more complex datasets like data warehouses.\nDMS has replication functions for on-premises to AWS or to Snowball or S3.\nMonitoring, Logging, and Reporting You can use the following automated monitoring tools to watch Amazon RDS and report when something is wrong:\nAmazon RDS Events – Subscribe to Amazon RDS events to be notified when changes occur with a DB instance, DB snapshot, DB parameter group, or DB security group. Database log files – View, download, or watch database log files using the Amazon RDS console or Amazon RDS API operations. You can also query some database log files that are loaded into database tables. Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring — Look at metrics in real time for the operating system. Amazon RDS Performance Insights — Assess the load on your database and determine when and where to act. Amazon RDS Recommendations — Look at automated recommendations for database resources, such as DB instances, read replicas, and DB parameter groups. In addition, Amazon RDS integrates with Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon EventBridge, and AWS CloudTrail for additional monitoring capabilities:\nAmazon CloudWatch Metrics – Amazon RDS automatically sends metrics to CloudWatch every minute for each active database. You don’t get additional charges for Amazon RDS metrics in CloudWatch. Amazon CloudWatch Alarms – You can watch a single Amazon RDS metric over a specific time period. You can then perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold that you set. Amazon CloudWatch Logs – Most DB engines enable you to monitor, store, and access your database log files in CloudWatch Logs. Amazon CloudWatch Events and Amazon EventBridge – You can automate AWS services and respond to system events such as application availability issues or resource changes. Events from AWS services are delivered to CloudWatch Events and EventBridge nearly in real time. You can write simple rules to indicate which events interest you and what automated actions to take when an event matches a rule. AWS CloudTrail – You can view a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon RDS. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon RDS as events. These captures include calls from the Amazon RDS console and from code calls to the Amazon RDS API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon RDS. If you don’t configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history.

You can now start building and running your Node.js application using \u0026#39;npm start\u0026#39;.${NC}** Creating a DB Instance on AWS To create a DB Instance on AWS, you can use the AWS Management Console with the option of Easy create either enabled or disabled. When Easy create is enabled, you only need to specify the DB engine type, DB Instance size, and DB Instance identifier. Easy create uses default settings for other configuration options. When Easy create is disabled, you need to specify more configuration options when creating a database, including options for availability, security, backups, and maintenance.\nNote: In the procedure below, the Standard create option is enabled, and Easy create is not. This procedure uses MySQL as an example.\nFor an example using Easy create to guide you in creating and connecting sample DB Instances for each engine, see Getting Started with Amazon RDS.\nTo create a DB Instance:\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.\nIn the upper right corner of the Amazon RDS console, select the AWS region where you want to create the DB Instance.\nIn the navigation pane, choose Databases.\nChoose Create database, and then select Standard create.\nFor Engine type, choose MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL. In this example, we are using Microsoft SQL Server.\nFor Database management type, if you are using Oracle or SQL Server, select Amazon RDS or Amazon RDS Custom.\nFor Edition, if you are using Oracle or SQL Server, select the version of the DB engine you want to use.\nFor Version, select the engine version.\nIn the Templates section, choose a template that matches your use case. If you choose Production, the following options will be pre-selected in the next step:\nMulti-AZ failover option Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) storage option Protection against deletion option We recommend using these features for a production environment.\nNote: Template choices may vary by version.\nTo enter your master password, follow these steps:\nIn the Settings section, open Credential Settings. If you want to specify a password, uncheck the Auto generate a password box if it\u0026rsquo;s already selected. (Optional) Change the Master username value. Enter the same password in both Master password and Confirm password. (Optional) Set up a connection to a compute resource for this DB Instance. You can configure the connection between an Amazon EC2 instance and the new DB Instance during the DB Instance creation process. For more information, see Configuring Automatic Network Connectivity to an EC2 Instance.\nIn the Connectivity section under VPC security group (firewall), if you choose Create new, a VPC security group with a login rule allowing your local computer\u0026rsquo;s IP address to access the database will be created.\nFor the remaining sections, specify your DB Instance settings. For more information on each setting, see Settings for DB Instances.\nChoose Create database.\nIf you choose to use an automatically generated password, the View credential details button will appear on the Databases page.\nTo view the master username and password for the DB Instance, select View credential details.\nTo connect to the DB Instance using the master username, use the displayed username and password.\nImportant: You cannot review the master user password. If you don\u0026rsquo;t record it, you may need to change it. If you need to change the master user password after the DB Instance is available, you can modify the DB Instance to do this. For more information on modifying a DB Instance, see Modifying an Amazon RDS DB Instance.\nUnder Databases, select the name of the new DB Instance. On the RDS console, information about the new DB Instance will appear. The DB Instance will have a Creating status until it is created and ready for use. Once the status changes to Available, you can connect to the DB Instance. Depending on the DB Instance class and allocated storage, it may take a few minutes for the new DB Instance to be available. Check RDS In the details page of the RDS instance, you can find connection-related information such as Endpoint, Port, and Username. The Endpoint is the URL or IP address you use to connect to the RDS database. Viewing Logs and Events on AWS RDS To monitor Logs and Events on Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), you can follow these steps:\nSign in to the AWS Management Console.\nChoose the Amazon RDS service from the AWS dashboard.\nSelect the RDS instance you want to view Logs and Events for.\nIn the instance details page, you will see the following tabs:\nDB instance details: Displays basic information about the instance. Configuration: Allows you to view and modify the instance\u0026rsquo;s configuration. Log \u0026amp; events: This is where you can view Logs and Events. Click on the Log \u0026amp; events tab. Here, you can view various logs such as:\nError log: Records errors that occur on the instance. General log: Records general activities on the instance. Slow query log: Records slow queries. Event log: Displays important events related to the instance. You can customize settings for viewing Logs and Events here, such as the time range you want to view logs or setting up email notifications for important events.\nRemember to regularly review logs and events to monitor the status of your Amazon RDS instance and detect any issues early.\nViewing Maintenance and Backups on AWS RDS In Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) provides an easy-to-manage relational database with automation for various tasks, including maintenance and backups. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can view information about maintenance and backups in AWS RDS:\nViewing Maintenance Information To view information about maintenance for a DB instance in RDS, you can follow these steps:\nSign in to the AWS Management Console.\nChoose the Amazon RDS service from the list of services.\nIn the RDS dashboard, select the DB instance you are interested in.\nIn the DB instance management page, navigate to the Maintenance \u0026amp; backups tab.\nHere, you will see information about the maintenance schedule, including the times when the DB instance will be automatically backed up and maintenance tasks will be performed. You can also view the history of previous maintenance events.\nViewing Backup Information To view information about backups of a DB instance in AWS RDS, follow these steps:\nSign in to the AWS Management Console.\nChoose the Amazon RDS service from the list of services.\nIn the RDS dashboard, select the DB instance you want to check.\nIn the DB instance management page, navigate to the Maintenance \u0026amp; backups tab.\nHere, you can view information about automatic backups and manual backups. You can also configure and manage backup settings.\nMake sure to follow relevant rules and policies when performing any tasks on AWS RDS to ensure the security and safety of your data.\n"},{"uri":"https://alicealicek2304.github.io/fcj-workshop/4-eventparticipated/","title":"Events Participated","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\r⚠️ Note: The information below is for reference purposes only.

Use the following command:\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS first_cloud_users; This command checks whether the database \u0026ldquo;first_cloud_users\u0026rdquo; exists or not. If it does not exist, it will create a new database named \u0026ldquo;first_cloud_users\u0026rdquo;.\nUsing Database Next, we use the \u0026ldquo;first_cloud_users\u0026rdquo; database using the command:\nUSE first_cloud_users; This command indicates that all SQL commands will then be executed in the \u0026ldquo;first_cloud_users\u0026rdquo; database.\nCreate Table \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; We have created the database and used it. Now, we will define a \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; table in this database using the following SQL script:\nCREATE TABLE `user`\r(\r`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\r`first_name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,\r`last_name` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,\r`email` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,\r`phone` VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,\r`comments` TEXT NOT NULL,\r`status` ENUM(\u0026#39;active\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;inactive\u0026#39;) NOT NULL DEFAULT \u0026#39;active\u0026#39;\r) ENGINE = InnoDB; This command defines the structure of the \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; table with columns such as \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;first_name\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;last_name\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;email\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;phone\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;comments\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;status\u0026rdquo;. These columns represent information about the user, and the \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; column is set as the auto-incrementing primary key.\nAdd Data to Table \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; Finally, we can add data to the \u0026ldquo;user\u0026rdquo; table using the INSERT INTO command.

After using this command, all subsequent SQL commands will apply to this database.\nDisplay tables in the current database: SHOW TABLES; This command will list all the tables present in the current database.\nShows the structure of a specific table: DESCRIBE table_name; This command will tell you the structure of the table named \u0026ldquo;table_name\u0026rdquo;, including the column name, data type, and other column properties.\nDisplay information about database size: SELECT table_schema \u0026#34;Database Name\u0026#34;, SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024 \u0026#34;Database Size (MB)\u0026#34;\rFROM information_schema.tables\rGROUP BY table_schema; This command will display information about the size of the databases in the system, in Megabytes (MB).\nRemember to replace \u0026ldquo;database_name\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;table_name\u0026rdquo; with the specific names of the database and table you want to test. These commands help you manage and examine information about your database.\nOnce you are in the application directory, run the following command to start the application using npm start: npm start Check EC2 Instance status: Make sure your EC2 Instance is running and functioning properly. Test the application in the browser: Open a web browser and enter the IP address or domain name of the EC2 Instance, followed by port 5000 (for example: http://\u0026lt;IP address or domain name\u0026gt; :5000). This will make a connection to your application running on port 5000.\nTest results: The browser will display your application if everything is configured correctly and the EC2 Instance is working. If not, you need to recheck the previous steps to identify the problem and fix it.\nhttp://\u0026lt;IP address or domain name\u0026gt;:5000 Monitoring AWS RDS On the AWS RDS interface, you can perform the following steps to monitor:\nSelect Databases. Choose the DB instance you\u0026rsquo;ve created. Select Monitoring. To view information about backups of the DB instance in AWS RDS, follow these steps:\nLog in to the AWS Management Console. Select the \u0026ldquo;Amazon RDS\u0026rdquo; service from the list of services. In the RDS dashboard, choose the DB instance you want to check. On the DB instance management page, navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Maintenance \u0026amp; backups\u0026rdquo; tab. Here, you can view information about automatic and manual backups. You can also configure and manage backup settings. View Snapshot information.\nChoose the DB snapshot you want to restore.\nIn the Actions section, select Restore snapshot. On the Restore snapshot page, enter a name for the DB instance you want to restore in the DB instance identifier field.\nSelect other settings such as allocated memory size.\nFor more information on each setting, refer to Settings for DB instances.\nFinally, select Restore DB instance.\nComplete the restore snapshot process.\nCheck the restored database instance.\n"},{"uri":"https://alicealicek2304.github.io/fcj-workshop/5-workshop/","title":"Workshop: Get Started with Amazon RDS","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) Overview of Amazon RDS ℹ️ Information: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a managed service that allows you to deploy and manage relational databases on AWS. Amazon RDS is designed for online transaction processing (OLTP) and is best suited for structured, relational data storage requirements.\nAmazon RDS provides key benefits:\nEasy replacement for traditional database instances Automated backups and patching during customer-defined maintenance windows One-click scaling, replication, and availability Supported Database Engines Amazon RDS supports the following database engines:\nAmazon Aurora MySQL MariaDB Oracle SQL Server PostgreSQL ⚠️ Warning: RDS is a managed service and you don\u0026rsquo;t have root access to the underlying EC2 server. The exception is Amazon RDS Custom, which allows access to the underlying operating system but is only available for a limited set of DB Engines.\nStorage Options General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2): Cost-effective storage providing 3 IOPS/GB baseline performance Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2): High-performance storage with customizable IOPS for I/O-intensive workloads Magnetic Storage: Legacy option with limited performance (not recommended for new deployments) 💡 Pro Tip: Choose General Purpose SSD for most workloads, and Provisioned IOPS only when you need consistent I/O performance for database-intensive applications.\nHigh Availability and Disaster Recovery Multi-AZ Deployments: Synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone for automatic failover Read Replicas: Asynchronous replication for read scaling and potential disaster recovery Global Databases: Cross-region replication with fast local reads and disaster recovery capabilities 🔒 Security Note: Multi-AZ deployments enhance both availability and data durability, with automatic failover typically completing within 60-120 seconds.\nSecurity Features Encryption at rest: Using AWS KMS keys (applies to DB instances, backups, snapshots, and replicas) Network isolation: Using Amazon VPC for network-level isolation Resource-level permissions: Using IAM policies SSL/TLS encryption: For data in transit Database authentication: Using database engine native authentication or IAM authentication Scalability and Limits Storage can be scaled up (not down) without downtime Compute resources can be modified with a brief downtime during the change Maximum storage: 64 TiB for most engines (16 TiB for SQL Server) Maximum database connections: Varies by engine and instance size 💡 Pro Tip: Plan your initial storage carefully as you can only scale up. Consider using Aurora for more flexible scaling options.\nBackup and Recovery Automated backups: Point-in-time recovery for up to 35 days Manual snapshots: User-initiated backups that persist until explicitly deleted Snapshot export to S3: For long-term retention or analysis When to Use Amazon RDS Amazon RDS is ideal for:\nTraditional relational database workloads Applications requiring SQL query capabilities Structured data with well-defined schemas OLTP workloads with predictable scaling needs ℹ️ Information: For unstructured data, high-scale requirements, or specialized workloads, consider alternative AWS database services like DynamoDB, DocumentDB, or purpose-built databases.\n"},{"uri":"https://alicealicek2304.github.io/fcj-workshop/5-workshop/6-backup/","title":"Backup and Restore","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Understanding Amazon RDS Backup and Restore ℹ️ **ℹ️\\ Information**: Amazon RDS provides automated backups and allows manual snapshots to ensure your database data is protected and can be recovered when needed.
