# Part I: Introduction to Kiro.dev (AWS Agentic IDE)

Kiro.dev (pronounced “keer-oh”) is an agentic AI-powered IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by a small team at Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is currently in public preview.

## 1. Goal & Key Features

*   **Goal:** Bridge the gap between "vibe coding" (rapid prototyping) and structured, tested, documented, and maintainable real-world software development.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **TaSpec-Driven Development:** Converts requirements into user stories, acceptance criteria, design documents, and task lists.
    *   **Agent Hooks / Automation:** Automatically triggers tasks like documentation generation, testing, and optimization upon events (file save, commit).
    *   **Steering:** Uses Markdown files to clearly define project structure, standards, and architecture.
    *   **Multi-file Capability:** Understands functional goals and executes necessary changes across multiple files.

## 2. Pros and Cons

| Type | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pros** | Increased transparency & control (spec review before code), Reduced boilerplate burden, Security & privacy (local code generation), Flexibility (external tool integration via Model Context Protocol). |
| **Cons** | Still in preview (incomplete features), May struggle with "context understanding" in complex projects (requires user supervision), Costs associated with agent interaction. |

## 3. Usage Recommendations

Kiro is suitable if you want to maintain a professional, structured workflow while leveraging AI for rapid prototyping, or if you want AI to be a "coding partner" rather than just a code suggestion tool.

# Part II: Important Notes on Effective AI Usage

Here are core experiences and principles when working with AI in software development projects:

## 1. Control Principles

*   **User must be in control:** AI is just an assistant; do not rely on it to control the project.
*   **Plan First & Review Frequently:** You MUST CREATE A PLAN FIRST (e.g., ask AI to create a plan file) to have a working framework and must frequently review (don't expect it to do everything).
*   **Code Manager Role:** Your value lies in code validation. You must be the one managing the code generated by AI.

## 2. Prompt Engineering & Requirement Definition

*   **Specific Role:** Assign a specific role to the AI (e.g., suggest using Amazon Q/CodeWhisperer).
*   **Prompt Templates:** Ask AI to create a plan, then filter and refine it. Request it to export files for storage and direct editing later.
*   **Clear Definition:**
    *   Create a new section when writing user stories.
    *   Define technology clearly for AI to follow.
    *   Instead of saying "don't implement this," say "implement this part" to increase success probability.
*   **Detailed Collaboration:** Collaborate with AI to create clear requirements and detailed information before asking AI to design and proceed.

## 3. Project Management

*   **Break Down Scope:** Divide large scope into scope units; each unit is a small project for easier implementation.
*   **Collaborate & Verify:** Ask AI to write user stories, then base project time estimation on them. Must have a team working together and verify all output code.
*   **Basic Process:** Requirement $\implies$ Unit $\implies$ Data Model $\implies$ ... $\implies$ Verify.

# Part III: Software Development Process Diagram (Agile/Scrum)

The software development process typically follows Agile/Scrum, involving roles such as Product Owner, Developer, and Tester.

## 1. Development Cycle

*   Starts from the **Backlog** (list of requirements), requirements are prioritized and assigned to each **Sprint**.
*   In each Sprint, the development team performs key activities: **Design**, **Code**, and **Test**.

## 2. Deliverables & Deployment Environments

*   **Artifacts:** Design documents, content maps, service interfaces, source code, configurations.
*   **Deployment Environments:** Products are sequentially deployed through environments:
    *   **Development (Dev)**
    *   **Testing (QA)**
    *   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
    *   **Production (Prod)** – Official running environment.

This process ensures the relationship between roles, activities, results, and deployment environments, helping control product quality before release to users.
