# Prerequisites

Before deploying the GameTracker application, we need to set up the foundational infrastructure. This includes the network layer (VPC), security configurations (IAM Roles, Security Groups), and necessary permissions.

In this section, we will:
1.  **Create Network Infrastructure**: VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, and Route Tables.
2.  **Create IAM Roles**: Execution roles for AWS Lambda.
3.  **Create Security Groups**: Firewall rules for our components.

These steps ensure a secure and isolated environment for our application.
