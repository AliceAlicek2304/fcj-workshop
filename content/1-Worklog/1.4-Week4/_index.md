### Week 4 Achievements:

* Successfully created a custom VPC and configured Subnets.

* Configured Internet Gateway and Route Tables to allow proper routing in the VPC.

* Learned the differences between Security Groups (stateful) and NACLs (stateless) and applied them.

* Deployed a basic Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic to multiple EC2 instances.

* Completed mini project: created a private VPC and deployed 2 EC2 instances behind the ALB, gaining hands-on experience in networking and load balancing.

* Became more confident in managing AWS networking resources and deploying a simple high-availability architecture.
