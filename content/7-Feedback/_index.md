**2. Training & Mentorship Quality**  
I would like to express my special thanks to the Mentors. They have been very patient and provided excellent guidance. Thanks to this, my programming mindset and self-learning skills have improved significantly. The support from the team regarding office procedures and event participation was also excellent.

Beyond improving technical capabilities (AWS, Docker, CI/CD), I have learned professional industrial working styles. Soft skills such as progress reporting, working in Agile/Scrum teams, and writing standard technical documentation are important assets for my future career.

**5. Company Culture**  
A culture of respect and responsibility is what I felt most clearly at FCJ.
