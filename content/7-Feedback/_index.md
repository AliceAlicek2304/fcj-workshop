> Below is my formal assessment regarding my internship experience with the First Cloud Journey program. I hope these insights contribute to the continuous improvement of the training program.

### Detailed Evaluation

**1. Professional Environment**  
I was impressed by the professional yet open working environment at the company. There is a strong culture of mutual support where colleagues are willing to assist regardless of their level. The workspace is well-organized and conducive to productivity. For future improvements, adhering to a more structured schedule for team events could further enhance team cohesion.

**2. Mentorship Quality**  
I highly appreciate the mentorship I received. My mentor demonstrated great patience and technical depth, guiding me through complex problems rather than simply providing solutions. This approach significantly improved my independent problem-solving capabilities. The Admin team also provided timely support with administrative procedures, allowing me to focus on my technical assignments.

**3. Academic Relevance**  
The internship successfully bridged the gap between academic theory and industry practice. I had the opportunity to apply my university knowledge to real-world Cloud Computing scenarios. This practical exposure has been invaluable in solidifying my understanding of system architecture and deployment strategies.

**4. Professional Development**  
Beyond technical proficiency in AWS and DevOps tools, I have developed essential soft skills such as effective communication, project documentation, and time management within an Agile framework. These experiences have prepared me well for a professional career in software engineering.

**5. Company Culture**  
The company fosters a culture of respect and collaboration. During critical project phases, I observed a high level of dedication and teamwork across all departments. Being treated as a contributing member of the team, rather than just an intern, gave me a strong sense of responsibility and belonging.

**6. Internship Benefits**  
The internship allowance is competitive, and the flexible working hours accommodated my academic schedule during examination periods. The internal knowledge-sharing sessions were also highly educational and added significant value to the internship program.
